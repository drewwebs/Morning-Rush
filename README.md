# Godshot

Godshot will be a coffee brewing training simulator.  

## Description
You will be tasked with a target dose weight and extraction time, and you will have to adjust grind size + grind time until you hit the exact specs!  The less time it takes you, the higher your score.

## Functionality

 - Godshot will animate your water as it moves throught he coffee grinds (quickly through course grinds, slowly through fine ones).
 - Users will be use sliders to adjust grind time and grind size, and then see how their shot pulls in real time.
 - Users will be able to choose from 3 difficulty settings which determine how out of spec the starting grind is.
