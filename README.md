# Shinigami Cafe

Shinigami cafe puts the user in the shoes of Ryuk, a god of death, trying to put his boredom to rest by serving guests at a busy coffee shop.  

## Description
Guests order drinks and walk down to the end of the bar to wait.  If you can't craft their drink and deliver it in time, they run out of patience, become frustrated, and leave.  5 frustrated guests and your game is over!

## Functionality

 - Guests' orders will follow them along the top of the screen, which will show you which orders you have yet to complete.
 - Users can interact with different elements of the shop to create drink components.  They can then combine components in order to create drinks.

## Wireframes

 - Morning Rush will be a single screen app with a view of a grinder and espresso machine.
