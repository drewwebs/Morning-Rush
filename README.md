# Godshot

Godshot will be a coffee brewing training simulator.  

## Description
You will be tasked with a target dose weight and extraction time, and you will have to adjust grind size + grind time until you hit the exact specs!  The less time it takes you, the higher your score.

## Functionality

 - Godshot will animate your water as it moves throught he coffee grinds (quickly through course grinds, slowly through fine ones).
 - Users will be use sliders to adjust grind time and grind size, and then see how their shot pulls in real time.
 - Users will be able to choose from 3 difficulty settings which determine how out of spec the starting grind is.
 - Production README

## Wireframes

 - Godshot will be a single screen app with a view of a grinder and espresso machine, along with two sliders and one "Grind!" button.

## Technologies
 Godshot will use the following technologies:
 - Vanilla Javascript for logic and jQuery for button inputs
 - Canvas for rendering and graphics
 
## Timeline
  ### Day 1:
   Initial setup.  Have project skeleton and basic site layout complete, with clickable buttons.
  ### Day 2: 
   Implement sliders that control appropriate parameters.  Work on canvas to get machine and grinder rendered on the page.  Output results of the grind and allow user to try again until godshot is achieved.
  ### Day 3: 
   Add animations for grinding coffee, and brewing coffee.  Brewing should give visual feedback that hints at when your parameters are off so that you can adjust accordingly.
## Bonus Features
  - Add different brew methods, such as Chemex and V60
